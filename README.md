## Troubleshooting

### Thumbnails Not Loading
- **HTTPS Enforcement**: Book thumbnails are forced to use HTTPS in the `Book.fromJson()` constructor.
- **CORS Issues**: During development, use a browser extension or configure your development environment to handle CORS policies.
- **Invalid URLs**: Debug by checking printed thumbnail URLs in the console (added in `Book.fromJson()`).

### Database Errors
- **Desktop Platforms**:
  ```dart
  // Add this initialization in main.dart
  sqfliteFfiInit();
  databaseFactory = databaseFactoryFfi;
